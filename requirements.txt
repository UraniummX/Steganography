Requirements

Pixel Guard is distributed as a standalone Windows application. No external dependencies are required to use the software. Users do not need to install Python, libraries, or additional runtime environments. The application is packaged as a compiled executable and runs independently on Windows systems. This ensures ease of use, portability, and accessibility for non-technical users.
(Optional developer note if you want, but not required):
For developers who wish to explore or modify the source code, Python 3 and the required libraries are needed. However, this is not necessary for normal usage.  
 # Pillow 
 # Tkinter 
 # pyinstaller

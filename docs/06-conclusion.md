# Conclusion and Future Work

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of binary mathematics in secure information hiding.

## Future Enhancements
- Stronger encryption methods
- Support for larger image formats
- extend the encryption type from symmetric to asymmetic with integrity validation via matching hashes.

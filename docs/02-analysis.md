# Analysis

## Problem Overview
This project focuses on securely embedding a secret message inside a digital image using binary-based techniques.

## Motivation
Traditional encryption makes data unreadable but visible. Steganography aims to hide the existence of the message itself.

## Approach Overview
The system uses binary manipulation of image pixel values to embed information while preserving visual quality.
